// N45Board: the iPod touch 1G (n45ap, recipe "n45") side of Recipe.create, for iPhone OS 1.x.
//
// Boot files: iBoot.bin (the IPSW's iBoot-204 IMG2 payload, which the machine enters at 0x18000000) and nor.bin
// (N45NOR over the IPSW's all_flash IMG2s). The bootrom (bootrom_s5l8900) is a boot input, like the 2G's.
// Volume: the IPSW rootfs grown to the recipe, then the 1.x bake of devos50's qemu-ios-generate-nand
// changes through SystemEdits: fstab rw with no /private/var line (one partition), the kernelcache (the
// IPSW's 8900 container, which the machine's 8900 engine decrypts) where iBoot loads it, the LaunchDaemons
// that changes.md keeps (and 1.1.3+'s lockbot), and the /var/root/Library skeleton; then ipod1g_device.bake:
// when the stock OpenGLES exports exactly
// opengles-1x.exports (a guest helper), the seed package's n45-ios1 hook (OpenGLES-1x, the GL front end) replaces it
// (the stock binary kept as OpenGLES.baked) and SpringBoard gets LK_ENABLE_OGL=1 LK_AUTO_ENABLE_OGL=0 (else
// LK_ENABLE_OGL stays unset: software LayerKit); the loader and the seed package go in either way, as on every board
// (the legacy-linked it_boot runs under 1.x launchd); an itpack without the hook is refused. The volume journaled (it
// is also /private/var); activation as every board has it; owners patched in the catalog. Store: N45NAND.
// No other guest tools on 1.x, no keybag, no seal.
//
// The recipe: storage "8g" (MA623; the only NAND geometry modeled), system_mib = the volume.
//
// The original iPhone (m68ap, recipe "m68", iPhone OS 1.0 1A543a) is this board with its own data: storage "4g"
// (MA501: the four chip enables its DT's flash disk names, reg 0x0f, of the same chips), an iPhone identity (an IMEI,
// a Bluetooth MAC; the UDID hashes both), btaddr beside wifiaddr in the nvram (iBoot fills arm-io/uart3/bluetooth from
// it), the NAND signature its iBoot-159 carries (C000). The LaunchDaemons kept are the same list (1.0 ships no
// AddressBook job), plus BTServer (qemu-ios models the M68's Bluetooth chip on UART3; without BTServer SpringBoard's
// BluetoothManager sleeps on its main thread through MobileBluetooth's attach retries, seconds per app launch);
// iapd goes (no accessory model).
