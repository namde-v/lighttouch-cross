// CFPreferences reads its domain's plist straight from disk and reloads it when the file changes: writing the file
// (as its owner, mobile) is the stock way to change a key from outside the process. Readers that cache a key at launch
// take it at their next launch: SpringBoard at a respring. (6.x and 7.x SpringBoard also rereads its debugging
// defaults on SIGUSR1, but its status bar keeps what it drew until something else changes it: a respring it is.)
